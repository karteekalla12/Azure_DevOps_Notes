## üìñ End-to-End Example Project

### üéØ Project Scenario
We are building a **Microservices-based E-commerce Application** for an online store.  
The application will:
- Run on **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**
- Use **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- Have a **CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps**
- Use **Docker** for packaging services
- Be monitored with **Prometheus + Grafana** and **Azure Monitor**
- Store secrets in **Azure Key Vault**

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Planning Phase**
- **Gather requirements** with business teams (payment gateways, user auth, inventory management, delivery tracking).
- **Choose architecture**: microservices (Node.js backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database).
- **Draw diagrams** using **Lucidchart**.
- **Plan sprints** in **Azure Boards** (Epics ‚Üí Features ‚Üí User Stories ‚Üí Tasks).
- **Decide environments**: Dev ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production.
- **Outcome:** Architecture diagram, backlog created, sprint schedule ready.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Source Control Setup**
- Create an **Azure DevOps Organization** and **Project**.
- Create repositories in **Azure Repos**:
  - `frontend-service`
  - `orders-service`
  - `payments-service`
  - `inventory-service`
  - `infrastructure`
- Implement **branching strategy** (GitFlow: `main`, `develop`, `feature/*`).
- Set **branch policies**: require PR reviews, linked work items, and successful build before merge.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Infrastructure Provisioning**
- **Terraform** scripts in `/infrastructure/` directory:
  - Resource Group
  - AKS Cluster
  - Azure Container Registry (ACR)
  - Azure Key Vault
  - Azure Database for PostgreSQL
- **Run Terraform** from Azure DevOps Pipeline:
  - terraform init
  - terraform plan
  - terraform apply


* **Outcome:** Fully provisioned Azure environment ready for deployments.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Application Development**

* Developers work on services in parallel.
* Use **Dockerfiles** for each service.
* Store env vars in Key Vault (e.g., database connection strings).
* Commit changes ‚Üí PR ‚Üí CI pipeline runs.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ CI Pipeline (Azure Pipelines)**

Example `.azure-pipelines.yml` for building and pushing Docker images:

```yaml
trigger:
  branches: [ develop ]

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

variables:
  registry: 'myacr.azurecr.io'

steps:
- task: Docker@2
  inputs:
    containerRegistry: 'ACR-Service-Connection'
    repository: '$(registry)/frontend-service'
    command: 'buildAndPush'
    Dockerfile: 'frontend/Dockerfile'
    tags: |
      $(Build.BuildId)
```

* CI tasks:

  * Lint & unit tests
  * Build Docker images
  * Push to ACR

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ CD Pipeline (Deployment to AKS)**

* Helm charts in `/helm/` directory.
* Azure DevOps Release pipeline:

  * Deploys Docker images from ACR
  * Runs `helm upgrade --install`
  * Applies ConfigMaps & Secrets from Key Vault

Example snippet:

```yaml
- task: HelmInstaller@1
  inputs:
    helmVersionToInstall: '3.9.0'

- task: HelmDeploy@0
  inputs:
    connectionType: 'Azure Resource Manager'
    azureSubscription: 'AzureRM-Service-Connection'
    azureResourceGroup: 'rg-devops'
    kubernetesCluster: 'aks-cluster'
    namespace: 'production'
    command: 'upgrade'
    chartType: 'FilePath'
    chartPath: 'helm/frontend-service'
```

---

### **7Ô∏è‚É£ Monitoring & Alerts**

* Install **Prometheus & Grafana** via Helm on AKS.
* Create custom Grafana dashboards (API latency, error rates).
* Set **Azure Monitor** alerts (CPU > 80%, failed deployments).
* Store logs in **Log Analytics Workspace**.

---

### **8Ô∏è‚É£ Security**

* Integrate **Trivy** in CI for image scanning.
* Use **Azure Key Vault** for API keys, passwords, DB creds.
* Enable RBAC for AKS and Azure resources.
* Set up pipeline approvals for production deployments.

---

### **9Ô∏è‚É£ Closing the Project**

* Document architecture, pipelines, and monitoring setup in `/docs/`.
* Conduct a **retrospective** with the team to identify improvements.
* Hand over:

  * Source code
  * Infrastructure code
  * Pipeline YAMLs
  * Monitoring dashboards
* Archive the Azure Boards project.
