Azure Resources & Resource Groups: The Complete DevOps Guide
------------------------------------------------------------

### What Are Azure Resources?

Azure **Resources** are individual, manageable components deployed within Azure. Think of them as the building blocks of your cloud infrastructure. Each resource represents a specific piece of functionality:

*   **Compute:** Virtual Machines (VMs), App Services, Azure Functions, Kubernetes Services (AKS)
    
*   **Storage:** Storage Accounts (Blob, File, Queue, Table), Managed Disks, Azure Data Lake
    
*   **Networking:** Virtual Networks (VNets), Load Balancers, Application Gateways, Network Security Groups (NSGs), Public IPs
    
*   **Databases:** Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB, MySQL/PostgreSQL Flexible Servers
    
*   **Security & Identity:** Key Vault, Azure Active Directory (AAD) resources, Managed Identities
    
*   **Management & Governance:** Log Analytics Workspaces, Application Insights, Policy Assignments
    
*   **Key Point:** Every resource belongs to **exactly one** Resource Group and exists within a specific Azure **Region**. Resources are managed via the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) API.
    

### What Are Azure Resource Groups?

Azure **Resource Groups (RGs)** are **logical containers** that hold related Azure resources. They are **NOT** security boundaries or billing boundaries by themselves (though they enable tagging for billing). Think of them as project folders for your cloud assets.

*   **Purpose:** Organize, manage, and deploy resources as a single unit. They provide a scope for:
    
    *   **Deployment:** Deploy, update, or delete all resources in the group together (using ARM templates, Bicep, Terraform).
        
    *   **Access Control (RBAC):** Assign permissions to manage _all_ resources within the group at once.
        
    *   **Monitoring & Management:** View aggregated metrics, logs, and alerts for the group. Apply resource locks.
        
    *   **Billing:** Apply tags to the RG to track costs for all contained resources.
        
*   **Key Constraint:** All resources within a single RG **must** reside in the **same Azure Region**. (You _can_ have multiple RGs in different regions within one Subscription).
    

### Applying the W/H Questions to Resources & Resource Groups

#### **What?**

*   **Resources:** Individual cloud services (VMs, DBs, Networks).
    
*   **Resource Groups:** Logical containers grouping related resources for unified management.
    

#### **Why? (The Critical DevOps Rationale)**

*   **Consistency & Repeatability:** Deploy the _entire application environment_ (web tier, app tier, DB, networking) as one atomic unit using Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Ensures environments (Dev, Test, Prod) are identical.
    
*   **Simplified Lifecycle Management:** Delete a non-prod environment (e.g., a feature branch test environment) by deleting _one_ RG – cleans up _all_ associated resources instantly, preventing "orphaned resource" sprawl and cost leakage.
    
*   **Access Control Efficiency:** Grant a DevOps team "Contributor" access to the prod-app-rg RG. They can manage _all_ production app resources without needing individual permissions on50+ resources. Apply "Reader" to the finance-cost-rg for finance team.
    
*   **Cost Tracking & Accountability:** Tag the customer-portal-prod-rg with CostCenter: WebTeam, Environment: Production. Finance can easily report costs for the production customer portal.
    
*   **Disaster Recovery:** Define RGs representing entire application stacks. Replicate the _entire RG_ (using Azure Site Recovery or IaC) to another region for DR.
    
*   **Governance Enforcement:** Apply Azure Policy _at the RG level_ (e.g., "All resources must use approved SKUs", "All storage accounts must be encrypted"). Ensures compliance for the whole application.
    

#### **Where?**

*   **Resources:** Physically deployed within a specific **Azure Region** (e.g., East US, West Europe).
    
*   **Resource Groups:** Exist at the **Subscription** level. They are a management construct _within_ a Subscription. Resources within an RG _must_ all be in the _same_ Region.
    

#### **When? (Creation Timing & Strategy)**

*   **Resource Group Creation:**
    
    *   **Early in Project Setup:** Before deploying _any_ application resources. Define your RG strategy (naming, tagging) upfront.
        
    *   **Per Environment:** app-dev-rg, app-test-rg, app-prod-rg is a common pattern.
        
    *   **Per Major Component/Application:** core-infra-rg (shared networking), customer-app-rg, analytics-rg.
        
    *   **Per Project/Initiative:** project-phoenix-rg.
        
    *   **Critical:** Created _before_ deploying the first resource that belongs to it.
        
*   **Resource Creation:**
    
    *   **During Application Deployment:** When provisioning VMs, databases, etc., via IaC (Terraform, ARM, Bicep) or the portal.
        
    *   **As Needed:** Adding a new storage account for a feature, scaling out VMs.
        

#### **Who? (Management & Responsibility)**

*   **Resource Group Owners/Contributors:** Typically **DevOps Engineers**, **Cloud Administrators**, **Platform Teams**. They manage the RG lifecycle (create, delete, apply locks/tags/policies) and grant access.
    
*   **Resource Users:** **Developers** (using App Services, Functions), **DBAs** (managing SQL DBs), **Security Teams** (managing Key Vault) – interact with resources _within_ the RGs they have access to.
    
*   **Governance Teams:** Apply policies and monitor compliance _at the RG level_.
    

#### **How? (Management Mechanisms - DevOps Focus)**

*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** **PRIMARY METHOD.** Define RGs and resources declaratively in Terraform, Bicep, or ARM templates. Ensures consistency, version control, and peer review. _Example (Bicep):_bicep123456789resource rg 'Microsoft.Resources/resourceGroups@2021-04-01' = { name: 'my-app-prod-rg' location: 'eastus' tags: { Environment: 'Production' Owner: 'DevOpsTeam' }}// Then deploy resources INTO this RG...
    
*   **Azure CLI / PowerShell:** Scriptable commands (az group create, New-AzResourceGroup) for automation pipelines (CI/CD).
    
*   **Azure Portal (UI):** Manual creation (see detailed walkthrough below) – useful for exploration, _not_ recommended for production deployments.
    
*   **Azure Policy:** Enforce RG naming conventions, required tags, or resource types within RGs.
    
*   **Resource Locks:** Apply CanNotDelete or ReadOnly locks _on the RG_ to prevent accidental deletion/modification of _all_ resources within it (critical for production).
    
    

# Creating Resources & Resource Groups via Azure Portal (UI): What You See & Why

## Starting Point
- **All services > Resource groups** (to create a Resource Group)
- **+ Create a resource** (to create a resource, which often prompts for a Resource Group)

---

## Resource Group Creation Screen

- **Subscription:** Dropdown  
  **Why:** You might have multiple subscriptions (e.g., Dev, Prod). Select where the Resource Group (RG) lives.

- **Resource group name:** Text box  
  **Why:** CRITICAL. Follow naming conventions (e.g., `rg---` like `rg-finance-prod-eastus`). Enables automation and clarity.

- **Region:** Dropdown  
  **Why:** THIS IS THE RG'S REGION. It does **not** force resources into this region, but all resources added to this RG **MUST** be deployed into this **SAME** region. Choose based on latency, compliance, or feature availability.

- **Tags (Optional but Crucial for DevOps):** Key/Value pairs (e.g., `Environment=Production`, `CostCenter=WebApp`, `Owner=DevOpsTeam`)  
  **Why:** Enables cost reporting, resource filtering, policy enforcement, and ownership tracking. Non-negotiable for mature DevOps.

- **Review + create:** Button  
  **Why:** Azure validates inputs and shows a deployment template preview. **Always review!**

---

## Resource Creation Screen (e.g., Virtual Machine)

### Project details:

- **Subscription:** Same as above.
- **Resource group:** Dropdown OR "Create new"  
  **Why:** Assign the resource to an existing RG or create a **new RG on the fly**. Choosing the correct RG is vital for management strategy. Creating a new RG here sets its region to the resource's region.

### Instance details:

- **Region:** Dropdown  
  **Why:** MUST MATCH the selected Resource Group's region. If you try to pick a different region than the RG, Azure blocks you. This enforces the RG region constraint.

- **Other resource-specific settings:** (e.g., VM size, OS, etc.)

- **Tags (Again!):**  
  **Why:** Inherit RG tags? Add resource-specific tags? Essential for granular tracking.

- **Review + create:** Button  
  **Why:** Final validation. Azure checks RG region compatibility, quota, permissions.
