# Azure Resource Groups - Q&A for DevOps

---

## 1. What is the single most important purpose of a Resource Group in Azure from a DevOps perspective?

To enable atomic deployment, management, and deletion of an entire application environment as a single unit using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring consistency and preventing resource sprawl.

---

## 2. Can resources in the same Resource Group be in different Azure regions? Why or why not?

No. All resources within a single Resource Group must reside in the same Azure region. The RG defines the regional scope for its contained resources; this is a core Azure constraint enforced during resource creation.

---

## 3. How would you structure Resource Groups for a multi-environment (Dev, Test, Prod) application?

I'd create separate RGs per environment, e.g., `rg-appname-dev`, `rg-appname-test`, `rg-appname-prod`. This isolates environments, simplifies lifecycle management (delete dev RG to clean up), enables environment-specific policies/tags, and prevents accidental production changes.

---

## 4. Why are tags on Resource Groups critical for DevOps teams?

Tags (like `Environment=Prod`, `CostCenter=TeamX`) enable automated cost reporting, resource filtering in monitoring/logging, policy enforcement (e.g., "Prod resources must have backup"), and ownership tracking – essential for accountability and operational efficiency at scale.

---

## 5. What happens if you accidentally delete a Resource Group?

All resources within that RG are permanently deleted. This is why applying `CanNotDelete` resource locks to production RGs and having robust IaC backups/recovery processes are non-negotiable DevOps practices.

---

## 6. How do Resource Groups relate to Azure RBAC?

Resource Groups are a primary scope for Role-Based Access Control. Granting "Contributor" on `prod-rg` gives a team full management rights over *all* resources within that production group, simplifying permission management significantly compared to individual resources.

---

## 7. When deploying resources via Terraform, should you create the Resource Group in the same configuration?

Absolutely. Defining the RG (`azurerm_resource_group`) within the same Terraform configuration/module as the application resources ensures the entire environment (RG + resources) is treated as a single, version-controlled, deployable unit – core IaC principle.

---

## 8. What's the difference between a Resource Group and a Management Group?

A Resource Group contains resources within a single region for deployment/management. A Management Group contains Subscriptions (and other MGs) for hierarchical governance (policies, RBAC inheritance) across multiple subscriptions – they operate at different scopes.

---

## 9. Can you move a resource from one Resource Group to another? What are the caveats?

Yes, but only within the same region and subscription. Critical caveats: It breaks dependencies (e.g., NSG linked to a NIC), requires resource-specific support (not all resources can be moved), and may cause brief downtime. Always test in non-prod first.

---

## 10. Why is naming your Resource Groups consistently important?

Consistent naming (e.g., `rg-<app>-<env>`) enables automation (scripts filter RGs by name), clear identification in logs/portals, policy targeting (e.g., "RGs named prod require encryption"), and reduces human error in management.

---

## 11. How would you prevent accidental deletion of a production Resource Group?

Apply an Azure Resource Lock of type `CanNotDelete` directly on the production Resource Group. This is a mandatory safeguard in any mature DevOps pipeline for production environments.

---

## 12. Do Resource Groups themselves incur cost?

No, the RG container is free. However, all resources *within* the RG incur standard Azure usage costs. The RG is purely a management boundary.

---

## 13. What is the maximum number of Resource Groups per Azure Subscription?

975 Resource Groups per subscription. While high, this emphasizes the need for a sensible RG strategy – don't create one per microservice if you have thousands; group logically.

---

## 14. How do Resource Groups facilitate disaster recovery?

By encapsulating an entire application stack (compute, storage, network) within a single RG, you can replicate the whole logical unit to another region using Azure Site Recovery or redeploy it via IaC from source control, simplifying DR orchestration.

---

## 15. Can you apply Azure Policy directly to a Resource? Why use the RG scope instead?

Yes, but applying policies at the Resource Group scope is far more efficient in DevOps. It ensures *all* resources (current and future) added to that RG (e.g., `prod-rg`) automatically inherit critical policies like encryption or tagging requirements.

---

## 16. What happens to resources if their Resource Group is locked with ReadOnly?

All resources within the RG become effectively read-only. You cannot modify, delete, or configure them (e.g., scaling VMs, changing DB settings) until the lock is removed. Useful for audit/compliance freezes.

---

## 17. In a CI/CD pipeline, when should you create the Resource Group?

The Resource Group should be created as the very first step in the infrastructure deployment phase of the pipeline, typically using IaC (Terraform/Bicep), before deploying any application resources into it.

---

## 18. Why is the Resource Group region chosen only at RG creation time critical?

Because it irrevocably sets the regional constraint for *all* future resources added to that RG. Choosing the wrong region here forces all application components into a suboptimal location, impacting latency and compliance.

---

## 19. How do Resource Groups help with cost management in large organizations?

By tagging RGs with `CostCenter`, `Project`, and `Environment`, finance teams can generate precise cost reports per business unit or application. An RG like `rg-marketing-campaign-prod` makes cost allocation unambiguous.

---

## 20. What's a common anti-pattern when using Resource Groups?

Putting *all* resources for an entire subscription into a single RG (e.g., `default-rg`). This negates all benefits – no environment isolation, impossible cost tracking per app, high risk of accidental deletion, and complex RBAC.

---

## 21. Can a resource exist outside a Resource Group?

No. Every Azure resource must belong to exactly one Resource Group. The RG is the mandatory top-level organizational container within a subscription.

---

## 22. How does the Resource Group concept align with the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) model?

ARM is the underlying deployment/control plane. Resource Groups are the fundamental management scope within ARM. ARM templates/deployments target a specific RG, treating all resources within it as a cohesive unit for transactional operations.

---

## 23. If you have a global application, how would you structure Resource Groups across regions?

I'd create separate RGs per region, e.g., `rg-app-global-eastus`, `rg-app-global-westeurope`. Each RG contains the full regional instance of the app. Global services (like Traffic Manager) might be in a dedicated `rg-app-global-core` RG.

---

## 24. What Azure feature relies heavily on Resource Groups for its operation?

Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates / Bicep. Deployments are scoped to a single RG. The template defines all resources within that RG, enabling atomic, consistent deployments – the bedrock of Azure DevOps.

---

## 25. How would you grant a developer team access only to test environments?

Apply RBAC roles (e.g., "Contributor") specifically on the `-test-` Resource Groups. This leverages the RG as the access boundary, automatically granting them rights to *all* test resources without touching prod RGs.

---

## 26. What information is not stored within a Resource Group?

Resource Groups do not store the actual data or configuration of the resources (like VM disks or DB data). They only store metadata: the RG name, region, tags, and the list of resource IDs within them.

---

## 27. Why might you have a dedicated Resource Group for networking resources?

To share core networking (VNets, Firewalls, DNS) securely across multiple application RGs (e.g., `rg-app1-prod`, `rg-app2-prod`) using VNet Peering, while maintaining separation of application logic and lifecycle management.

---

## 28. How do Resource Groups impact Azure Monitor configuration?

You can configure diagnostic settings, alerts, and log queries scoped to a Resource Group. This allows monitoring the health and performance of the entire application stack within the RG as a single entity.

---

## 29. What's the relationship between a Resource Group and an Azure Subscription?

A Subscription is the billing and top-level security boundary (contains RGs). A Resource Group is a logical container *within* a Subscription used to organize and manage resources. One Subscription contains many RGs.

---

## 30. In an IaC pipeline, how do you handle RG creation if it might already exist?

Use the IaC tool's native idempotency. Terraform/Bicep will safely create the RG if it doesn't exist or do nothing if it does (assuming config matches). Never hardcode "create RG" without idempotency checks.

---

## 31. What Azure limit is directly tied to Resource Groups?

The resource-level quota (e.g., max VMs per region) is enforced per Resource Group. If you hit the VM limit in `rg-app-prod`, you need to request a quota increase specifically for that RG in that region.

---

## 32. How can Resource Groups simplify Azure Policy remediation?

By scoping remediation tasks (e.g., enabling encryption) to a specific Resource Group, you target *all* non-compliant resources within that logical application boundary in one operation, rather than hunting resources individually.

---

## 33. Why is the "Review + create" step crucial when creating an RG via the portal?

It validates the RG name (uniqueness within subscription), region, and shows the ARM template preview. Skipping this risks creating an RG with an invalid name or wrong region, causing downstream deployment failures – a key reason portal use for prod is discouraged.
